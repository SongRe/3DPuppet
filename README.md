# 3DPuppet



An interactive OpenGL project that renders a 3D Lua puppet model, allowing real-time manipulation of its joints and rotations. The project provides an intuitive interface to adjust various parameters, making it ideal for experimenting with skeletal animation and real-time 3D transformations.

## Features

- 3D Puppet Rendering: Uses OpenGL to display a fully articulated 3D puppet.
- Joint Manipulation: Rotate and adjust joints dynamically.
- Transformations: Modify position, rotation, and other attributes interactively.
- Extendable Lua Puppet: Any Lua Puppet model that follows the same structure will work. 
- Undo/Redo: Ability to undo/redo joint transformations
- Resets: Can reset position, orientation, joints, or all
